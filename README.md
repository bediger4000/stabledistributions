# Stable Distributions

From the Wikipedia article on
[stable distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution):
> a distribution is said to be stable if a linear combination of two independent
> random variables with this distribution has the same distribution, up to
> location and scale parameters.

> When U and V are two independent normally distributed random variables
> with expected value 0 and variance 1,
> then the ratio U/V has the standard Cauchy distribution.
